After updating to AMI v20191119 the allocatable memory went down from 16132820Ki to 13461148Ki. Also the allocatable CPU went down to 3920m which is less important.

I need a way to specify that a lambda function is long-lived / pinned – see  <a href="http://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/services/greengrass.html?highlight=greengrass#Greengrass.Client.create_function_definition">create_function_definition</a>

I can package these changes up into a PR if that's helpful." ]]></description></item></channel></rss>
