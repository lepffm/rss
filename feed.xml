		[Comment/question today](https://github.com/github/choosealicense.com/pull/320#issuecomment-230746990) about whether EUPL-1.1 is accurately described reminded me to file this enhancement idea.\n\nFor each license, license rules could be annotated with ranges of text in the license pertinent to the rule. Highlighting of ranges could be turned on/off on individual license pages by selecting in the license rules (permissions/conditions/limitations) table. Very crude mockup taking a very simple case (the one condition of MIT).\n\n![mit-highlight-condition](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/40415/16633043/25735510-437c-11e6-84f8-1e504d48f345.png)\n\nObviously this is not a big help for MIT, but for longer licenses, it can be tricky to figure out what bits of the license are pertinent for a particular rule, at least if you only want to read once, which is more already than I suspect most people do.\n\nSuch annotations _might_ be very helpful to \"demystify\" licenses, and creating them might be good QA for choosealicense.com license descriptions.\n\nProbably the simplest way to to annotate would be to have one or more full text extracts for each license for each rule, though there are other ways to do it, inline or [out of band](https://github.com/hypothesis/h/wiki/robust-anchors).\n\nVery low priority, may even be a bad idea, just recording it for now.\n
