While playing around with `ActionView::Component` i noticed that it is not possible to render components in the controller. I saw, that you are monkey patching `ActionView::Base#render`. So i tried to override the `render` method in my `ApplicationController` in a similar way, but without success.<br/><br/>At the moment users are forced to write templates with a single line: `<%= render(PostShowComponent, post: @post)
 %>`. It would be great to have an API like this:<br/><br/>```ruby <br/>class PostsController < ApplicationController<br/>  def show <br/>    post = Post.find(params[:id])
<br/>    render(PostShowComponent, post: post)
<br/>  end<br/>end<br/>```<br/>I could provide a PR with a failing feature test, if that helps. <br/><br/>Thank you , ushi<br/><br/>P.S. Found a workaround. Maybe its a good starting point:<br/><br/>```ruby<br/>class ApplicationController<br/>  private<br/><br/>  def render_component(component, args, **options)
<br/>    options = options.reverse_merge(layout: true)
<br/>    render(html: view_context.render(component, args)
, options)
<br/>  end <br/>end<br/>```<br/><br/>" ]]></description></item><item>	<title>Finish migrating to `pathtype` library.</title>	<link>https://github.com/github/semantic/issues/288</link>	<description><![CDATA[The migration to `pathtype` has been overall a pleasant one—it makes functions much more indicative of their purpose, and it’s caught some bugs (though not serious ones)
. Right now we’re an uneasy hybrid of `pathtype` solutions and `FilePath`; we should move off of the latter completely. This involves overhauling `Semantic.CLI` to use `pathtype`; the  <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pathtype-0.8.1">documentation</a> 

 provides a recipe to make `optparse-applicative` parsers do the right thing (respecting the path semantics; i.e., if we tell a parser to expect an absolute path, the parser will fail unless said path is actually absolute.)
