<br/>It's also impossible to mock `render` on the `controller.view_context` as this is a new instance on every call. <br/><br/>I've found this workaround, but it's rather unwieldy:<br/>```ruby<br/>  let(:instance)
 { MyComponent.new(my_params: 'val')
 }<br/><br/>  before do<br/>    allow(MyComponent)
.to receive(:new)
.and_return(instance)
<br/>    allow(instance)
.to receive(:render)
<br/>  end<br/><br/>  it \"calls render\" do<br/>    render_inline(MyComponent, my_params: 'val')
<br/>    expect(instance)
.to have_received(:render)
.with('catalog/facet_group', param1: 'foo')
<br/>  end<br/>```" ]]></description>

   <title>Allow rendering components in the controller</title>	
   <link>https://github.com/github/actionview-component/issues/38</link>	<description><![CDATA[Hi @joelhawksley <br/><br/>I am happy to see a view model lib, that integrates smoothly with rails. While playing around with `ActionView::Component` i noticed that it is not possible to render components in the controller. I saw, that you are monkey patching `ActionView::Base#render`. So i tried to override the `render` method in my `ApplicationController` in a similar way, but without success.<br/><br/>At the moment users are forced to write templates with a single line: `<%= render(PostShowComponent, post: @post)
 %>`. It would be great to have an API like this:<br/><br/><code> <br/>class PostsController < ApplicationController<br/>  def show <br/>    post = Post.find(params[:id])
<br/>    render(PostShowComponent, post: post)
<br/>  end<br/>end<br/></code><br/>I could provide a PR with a failing feature test, if that helps. <br/><br/>Thank you , ushi<br/><br/>P.S. Found a workaround. Maybe its a good starting point:<br/><br/>```ruby<br/>class ApplicationController<br/>  private<br/><br/>  def render_component(component, args, **options)
<br/>    options = options.reverse_merge(layout: true)
<br/>    render(html: view_context.render(component, args)
, options)
<br/>  end <br/>end<br/>```<br/><br/>" ]]></description></item><item>	<title>Any tips for rendering Components from collections?</title>	<link>https://github.com/github/actionview-component/issues/21</link>	<description><![CDATA[Before I start playing around with this, I wanted to ask if there is a preferred way, best practice, or even a helper to render components for collections  <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/layouts_and_rendering.html#rendering-collections">similar to the rails guide for partials</a> 

<br/><br/>I think this would be a common use case, and would be willing to submit a PR for a documentation example." ]]></description></item><item>	<title>Question about tags</title>	<link>https://github.com/github/octocatalog-diff/issues/209</link>	<description><![CDATA[Is there any way to have octocatalog-diff do the opposite of --ignore-tags?  I'd like to be able to specify one or more tags and have octocatalog-diff only compare resources containing those tags?  This would help predict the behavior of running puppet with those tags." ]]></description></item><item>	<title>Consider not using LCS by default or allow switching it off</title>	<link>https://github.com/github/octocatalog-diff/issues/207</link>	<description><![CDATA[Hi,<br/><br/> <a href="https://github.com/github/octocatalog-diff/blob/master/lib/octocatalog-diff/catalog-diff/differ.rb#L525">Hashdiff</a> 

 uses  <a href="https://github.com/liufengyun/hashdiff#use_lcs">LCS by default</a> 

 when comparing arrays. This algorithm produces a friendlier and easier to read diff for humans, but at  <a href="https://github.com/liufengyun/hashdiff/issues/49">high cost</a>
