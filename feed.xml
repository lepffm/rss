. Right now we’re an uneasy hybrid of `pathtype` solutions and `FilePath`; we should move off of the latter completely. This involves overhauling `Semantic.CLI` to use `pathtype`; the  <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pathtype-0.8.1">documentation</a> 

 provides a recipe to make `optparse-applicative` parsers do the right thing (respecting the path semantics; i.e., if we tell a parser to expect an absolute path, the parser will fail unless said path is actually absolute.)
