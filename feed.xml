	<title>Annotating license texts with license rules</title>
	<link>https://github.com/github/choosealicense.com/issues/441</link>
<description>[Comment/question today](https://github.com/github/choosealicense.com/pull/320#issuecomment-230746990) about whether EUPL-1.1 is accurately described reminded me to file this enhancement idea.\n\nFor each license, license rules could be annotated with ranges of text in the license pertinent to the rule. Highlighting of ranges could be turned on/off on individual license pages by selecting in the license rules (permissions/conditions/limitations) table. Very crude mockup taking a very simple case (the one condition of MIT).\n\n![mit-highlight-condition](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/40415/16633043/25735510-437c-11e6-84f8-1e504d48f345.png)\n\nObviously this is not a big help for MIT, but for longer licenses, it can be tricky to figure out what bits of the license are pertinent for a particular rule, at least if you only want to read once, which is more already than I suspect most people do.\n\nSuch annotations </description>

	<title>XML report for CI</title>
	<link>https://github.com/github/licensed/issues/52</link>
<description>Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm integrating licensed for a poc in our Jenkins pipeline. It could be great to get a report of all licenses checks in an XML formatted file; so we can process it using Jenkins plugins. For now, I have to analyse the `XXX dependencies checked, XXX warnings found.` string formatted output of `licensed status` command.\r\n\r\nWe can consider **licensed results** as **tests results**.\r\n* If all licenses check passed; then the overall test is **passed**.\r\n* If one license is found as unknown, or not matching any of allowed, ignored or reviewed configs; then the check/test **failed**.\r\n\r\nStandards test output formats such as junit, nunit, mstest, google-test, etc. would be great cos already known by many CI tools. Junit is probably the most used one.\r\n\r\nOrganizing tests in \"groups\" matching the package type (npm, pip, go, etc.) and license type (mit, gpl...) would also allows to \"count\" the type of licenses found... providing some kind of statistics ^\r\n\r\nExample of output in Jenkins test plugin results, processing the XML file could be:\r\n```\r\nPackage                  Fail Skip Pass Total\r\n- total                     0    0   69    69\r\n- npm                       0    0   53    53\r\n  - mit                     0    0   45    45\r\n    - package1              0    0    1     1\r\n    - package 2             ...\r\n    - ...\r\n  - apache-2.0                              3\r\n    - package46\r\n    - ...\r\n  - bsd-3-clause                            1 \r\n    - package49\r\n  - isc                                     1\r\n    - package50\r\n  - unknown                                 3\r\n    - package51             1    0    0     1\r\n    - ...\r\n- go                                       16\r\n  - mit                                    14\r\n    - ...\r\n  - isc                                     1\r\n    - ...\r\n  - unknown                                 1\r\n    - packagexx             1    0    0     1\r\n    - ...\r\n```\r\nI did not fill the array; but you've got the point ;-)\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nChris"</description>

<description>As found in https://github.com/github/licensed/issues/30#issuecomment-386129385\r\n\r\n> The errors appear to be because my package.json file is actually intended for yarn, and uses some syntax that is not npm-compatible\r\n\r\n[Yarn's](https://yarnpkg.com/) `package.json` files attempt to be compatible with NPM `package.json` files but can contain differences that cause the NPM dependency source to fail.\r\n\r\nIt looks like an indicator that yarn should be used and that npm shouldn't be used is the presence of a `yarn.lock` file."</description>

	<title>Finish migrating to `pathtype` library.</title>
	<link>https://github.com/github/semantic/issues/288</link>
<description>The migration to `pathtype` has been overall a pleasant one—it makes functions much more indicative of their purpose, and it’s caught some bugs (though not serious ones). Right now we’re an uneasy hybrid of `pathtype` solutions and `FilePath`; we should move off of the latter completely. This involves overhauling `Semantic.CLI` to use `pathtype`; the [documentation](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pathtype-0.8.1) provides a recipe to make `optparse-applicative` parsers do the right thing (respecting the path semantics; i.e., if we tell a parser to expect an absolute path, the parser will fail unless said path is actually absolute.)"</description>

This also happens when the app is launched from the command line (Eg. for deleting/listing registrations). If the app is already running in the background we'll get an error because the kext only allows one connection. This error is surfaced to the user, which is confusing. We should not connect to the kext unless we need to."</description>

	<title>Timestamp stage add a fudged timestamp for lines missing a timestamp</title>
	<link>https://github.com/grafana/loki/issues/1093</link>
<description>If using the timestamp stage and processing multi-line log lines, (or log lines that might not have a timestamp), the behavior could be a bit unpredictable.   \r\n\r\nIf the timestamp stage fails to match the timestamp, the promtail system time will be used for the log line, this creates a race between the last processed log lines timestamp and the system time, potentially leading to Loki rejecting the log line which had no timestamp as being older than the previous, or possibly the next log line with a timestamp being rejected if it's timestamp is older than what the system time applied was.\r\n\r\nI am suggesting an option be added to the timestamp stage to allow fudging a timestamp onto log lines which do not have one.  The stage should keep track of the previous lines timestamp and if the next line coming in doesn't have a timestamp, increment the previous timestamp by one nanosecond and use that as the timestamp.\r\n\r\nFudging a timestamp is not great and could potentially lead to problems however, with nanosecond precision I would hope this to be very unlikely.\r\n\r\nI also think the default for this behavior should be enabled, with an option to disable it"</description>

	<title>[helm] Deploying loki-stack with prometheus &amp; grafana fails in k8s 1.16</title>

	<title>Add support for multiple deployoment OU in nested structure</title>
	<link>https://github.com/awslabs/aws-deployment-framework/issues/130</link>
<description>We're looking to implement ADF for our organisation, and at the moment it works pretty well for just our team. In future, if all goes smoothly with our spike, we'll likely be looking to roll this out to multiple teams in the larger group, we wouldn't want to share a deployment account since we need that separation (and there would be a lot of pipelines in there getting cluttered). However we do still share an Organization (billing reasons, Security, etc), and we think it would be great if ADF could support multiple deployment accounts in a similar structure as listed below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n+ root org\r\n     + team1\r\n          + deployment\r\n               - tooling-account (isolated to only allow deployment to units within team1)\r\n          + production\r\n               - team1-prod\r\n          + staging\r\n               - team1-staging\r\n     + team2\r\n          + deployment\r\n               - tooling-account (isolated to only allow deployment to units within team2)\r\n          + production\r\n               - team2-prod\r\n          + staging\r\n               - team2-staging\r\n     + team3\r\n          + deployment\r\n               - tooling-account (isolated to only allow deployment to units within team3)\r\n          + production\r\n               - team3-prod\r\n          + staging\r\n               - team3-staging\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs this the sort of feature that could be implemented at some point? Its my understanding that currently the tool only supports one deployment account due to the system-parameters upon initialisation.\r\n\r\nAnother structure that could work, but we aren't sure if its possible/how to implement:\r\n\r\n```\r\n+ root org\r\n    + deployment\r\n         - team1-tooling\r\n         - team2-tooling\r\n         - team3-tooling\r\n     + team1\r\n          + production\r\n               - team1-prod\r\n          + staging\r\n               - team1-staging\r\n     + team2\r\n          + production\r\n               - team2-prod\r\n          + staging\r\n               - team2-staging\r\n     + team3\r\n          + production\r\n               - team3-prod\r\n          + staging\r\n               - team3-staging\r\n```"</description>

Thought importing com.amazon.janusgraph.diskstorage.dynamodb.DynamoDBStoreManager would be enough - I have dynamodb-janusgraph-storage-backend listed as a dependency in my pom.xml file so everything is compiling just fine.\r\n\r\nI've found examples of how to use Gremlin with dynamodb/janusgraph but nothing about how to set things up purely in Java. An example would be greatly appreciated."</description>
