	<title>Annotating license texts with license rules</title>
	<link>https://github.com/github/choosealicense.com/issues/441</link>
	<description><![CDATA[[Comment/question today](https://github.com/github/choosealicense.com/pull/320#issuecomment-230746990) about whether EUPL-1.1 is accurately described reminded me to file this enhancement idea.<br/><br/>For each license, license rules could be annotated with ranges of text in the license pertinent to the rule. Highlighting of ranges could be turned on/off on individual license pages by selecting in the license rules (permissions/conditions/limitations) table. Very crude mockup taking a very simple case (the one condition of MIT).<br/><br/>![mit-highlight-condition](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/40415/16633043/25735510-437c-11e6-84f8-1e504d48f345.png)<br/><br/>Obviously this is not a big help for MIT, but for longer licenses, it can be tricky to figure out what bits of the license are pertinent for a particular rule, at least if you only want to read once, which is more already than I suspect most people do.<br/><br/>Such annotations  ]]></description>

	<title>Alphabetize, other chores should run monthly, open new PRs automatically</title>
	<link>https://github.com/github/government.github.com/issues/601</link>
	<description><![CDATA[Currently, the alphabetize script (https://github.com/github/government.github.com/blob/gh-pages/script/alphabetize)  is run manually to clean up the ordering of Organizations in the various data files. (Example: https://github.com/github/government.github.com/pull/582). A couple problems with this:<br/><br/>1. Why do work that a robot 🤖 can do?<br/>2. Since this repo is widely maintained, it's impossible to guarantee that these changes won't create pretty annoying conflicts for other PRs. <br/><br/>Getting these to a near automated fashion would be really cool.<br/><br/>I'd held off merging a bunch of [open PRs](https://github.com/github/government.github.com/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Apr%20is%3Aopen%20updated%3A%3E2017-07-01) in hopes that I'd get time to work on a solution for this, but alas I have not. So, I figure I'll crowd source this to see if anyone has any ideas or fancy the execution.<br/><br/>## Note<br/>I'd love to use [probot](https://probot.github.io) as the framework for these operations (it's what it was made for), but it's currently a node app and is expecting j/s scripts. Since I try to do as little with YAML as possible 😉 , this task was never exciting enough to get my attention for very long, and why it floundered. It should be pretty easy as `js-yaml` and basic JS functions should map pretty cleanly.<br/><br/>By opening this issue, this will be a reminder to me to eventually get to it too, so no pressure." ]]></description>

	<title>XML report for CI</title>
	<link>https://github.com/github/licensed/issues/52</link>
	<description><![CDATA[Hi,<br/><br/>I'm integrating licensed for a poc in our Jenkins pipeline. It could be great to get a report of all licenses checks in an XML formatted file; so we can process it using Jenkins plugins. For now, I have to analyse the `XXX dependencies checked, XXX warnings found.` string formatted output of `licensed status` command.<br/><br/>We can consider **licensed results** as **tests results**.<br/>* If all licenses check passed; then the overall test is **passed**.<br/>* If one license is found as unknown, or not matching any of allowed, ignored or reviewed configs; then the check/test **failed**.<br/><br/>Standards test output formats such as junit, nunit, mstest, google-test, etc. would be great cos already known by many CI tools. Junit is probably the most used one.<br/><br/>Organizing tests in \"groups\" matching the package type (npm, pip, go, etc.) and license type (mit, gpl...) would also allows to \"count\" the type of licenses found... providing some kind of statistics ^<br/><br/>Example of output in Jenkins test plugin results, processing the XML file could be:<br/>```<br/>Package                  Fail Skip Pass Total<br/>- total                     0    0   69    69<br/>- npm                       0    0   53    53<br/>  - mit                     0    0   45    45<br/>    - package1              0    0    1     1<br/>    - package 2             ...<br/>    - ...<br/>  - apache-2.0                              3<br/>    - package46<br/>    - ...<br/>  - bsd-3-clause                            1 <br/>    - package49<br/>  - isc                                     1<br/>    - package50<br/>  - unknown                                 3<br/>    - package51             1    0    0     1<br/>    - ...<br/>- go                                       16<br/>  - mit                                    14<br/>    - ...<br/>  - isc                                     1<br/>    - ...<br/>  - unknown                                 1<br/>    - packagexx             1    0    0     1<br/>    - ...<br/>```<br/>I did not fill the array; but you've got the point ;-)<br/><br/>Regards,<br/><br/>Chris" ]]></description>

	<title>Finish migrating to `pathtype` library.</title>
	<link>https://github.com/github/semantic/issues/288</link>
	<description><![CDATA[The migration to `pathtype` has been overall a pleasant one—it makes functions much more indicative of their purpose, and it’s caught some bugs (though not serious ones). Right now we’re an uneasy hybrid of `pathtype` solutions and `FilePath`; we should move off of the latter completely. This involves overhauling `Semantic.CLI` to use `pathtype`; the [documentation](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pathtype-0.8.1) provides a recipe to make `optparse-applicative` parsers do the right thing (respecting the path semantics; i.e., if we tell a parser to expect an absolute path, the parser will fail unless said path is actually absolute.)" ]]></description>

This also happens when the app is launched from the command line (Eg. for deleting/listing registrations). If the app is already running in the background we'll get an error because the kext only allows one connection. This error is surfaced to the user, which is confusing.

	<title>Timestamp stage add a fudged timestamp for lines missing a timestamp</title>
	<link>https://github.com/grafana/loki/issues/1093</link>
	<description><![CDATA[If using the timestamp stage and processing multi-line log lines, (or log lines that might not have a timestamp), the behavior could be a bit unpredictable.   <br/><br/>If the timestamp stage fails to match the timestamp, the promtail system time will be used for the log line, this creates a race between the last processed log lines timestamp and the system time, potentially leading to Loki rejecting the log line which had no timestamp as being older than the previous, or possibly the next log line with a timestamp being rejected if it's timestamp is older than what the system time applied was.<br/><br/>I am suggesting an option be added to the timestamp stage to allow fudging a timestamp onto log lines which do not have one.  The stage should keep track of the previous lines timestamp and if the next line coming in doesn't have a timestamp, increment the previous timestamp by one nanosecond and use that as the timestamp.<br/><br/>Fudging a timestamp is not great and could potentially lead to problems however, with nanosecond precision I would hope this to be very unlikely.<br/><br/>I also think the default for this behavior should be enabled, with an option to disable it" ]]></description>

	<title>tab completion shows too much of the path.</title>

	<description><![CDATA[If I do `cd environments/` then press tab, I will see listed the directories inside `environments`.<br/><br/>If I do the same with `tk diff environments`, I will see `environments/default/blah`. It would be more helpful if it stripped off the `environments` portion, as I have already committed to that part of the path.<br/><br/>Also, it currently lists *all* of the paths that have a `main.jsonnet`. This is neat, but gives too many options. I would expect a sequence such as:<br/><br/>```<br/>$ tk diff env<TAB><br/>$ tk diff environments/<br/>$ tk diff environments/<TAB><br/>default hosted-grafana cortex loki cassandra blah<br/>$ tk diff environments/cor<TAB><br/>$ tk diff environments/cortex/<br/>$ tk diff environments/cortex/<TAB><br/>eu-west2.dev eu-west2.prod ops-tools1-us-east4.cortex blah<br/>$ tk diff environments/cortex/ops<TAB><br/>$ tk diff environments/cortex/ops-tools1-us-east4.cortex<br/>```<br/>Here it has stopped completing, i.e. didn't put a `/` at the end of the dir, because there is a `main.jsonnet` file in that directory.<br/><br/>This would allow me to navigate swiftly to where I want to be without overfilling my screen. <br/>" ]]></description>

	<title>Add support for multiple deployoment OU in nested structure</title>
	<link>https://github.com/awslabs/aws-deployment-framework/issues/130</link>
	<description><![CDATA[We're looking to implement ADF for our organisation, and at the moment it works pretty well for just our team. In future, if all goes smoothly with our spike, we'll likely be looking to roll this out to multiple teams in the larger group, we wouldn't want to share a deployment account since we need that separation (and there would be a lot of pipelines in there getting cluttered). However we do still share an Organization (billing reasons, Security, etc), and we think it would be great if ADF could support multiple deployment accounts in a similar structure as listed below:<br/><br/>```<br/>+ root org<br/>     + team1<br/>          + deployment<br/>               - tooling-account (isolated to only allow deployment to units within team1)<br/>          + production<br/>               - team1-prod<br/>          + staging<br/>               - team1-staging<br/>     + team2<br/>          + deployment<br/>               - tooling-account (isolated to only allow deployment to units within team2)<br/>          + production<br/>               - team2-prod<br/>          + staging<br/>               - team2-staging<br/>     + team3<br/>          + deployment<br/>               - tooling-account (isolated to only allow deployment to units within team3)<br/>          + production<br/>               - team3-prod<br/>          + staging<br/>               - team3-staging<br/>```<br/><br/>Is this the sort of feature that could be implemented at some point? Its my understanding that currently the tool only supports one deployment account due to the system-parameters upon initialisation.<br/><br/>Another structure that could work, but we aren't sure if its possible/how to implement:<br/><br/>```<br/>+ root org<br/>    + deployment<br/>         - team1-tooling<br/>         - team2-tooling<br/>         - team3-tooling<br/>     + team1<br/>          + production<br/>               - team1-prod<br/>          + staging<br/>               - team1-staging<br/>     + team2<br/>          + production<br/>               - team2-prod<br/>          + staging<br/>               - team2-staging<br/>     + team3<br/>          + production<br/>               - team3-prod<br/>          + staging<br/>               - team3-staging<br/>```" ]]></description>

	<title>trouble with connecting to dynamodb through Java</title>
	<link>https://github.com/awslabs/dynamodb-janusgraph-storage-backend/issues/233</link>
	<description><![CDATA[Hi - I have the following Java code which I am trying to use to have Janusgraph connect to the cloud dynamodb (as opposed to the local test version).<br/><br/>import org.apache.commons.configuration.BaseConfiguration;<br/>import com.amazon.janusgraph.diskstorage.dynamodb.DynamoDBStoreManager;<br/>import org.janusgraph.core.JanusGraphFactory;<br/>import org.janusgraph.core.JanusGraph;<br/>.....<br/>BaseConfiguration conf = new BaseConfiguration();<br/>conf.setProperty(\"storage.backend\",\"com.amazon.janusgraph.diskstorage.dynamodb.DynamoDBStoreManager\");<br/>....JanusGraph graph = JanusGraphFactory.open(conf);<br/><br/>The error I'm getting when trying to run is:<br/>\"errorMessage\": \"Could not instantiate implementation: com.amazon.janusgraph.diskstorage.dynamodb.DynamoDBStoreManager\",<br/>....<br/>\"errorType\": \"java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError\",<br/><br/>Is this a bug or am I missing something? Thought importing com.amazon.janusgraph.diskstorage.dynamodb.DynamoDBStoreManager would be enough - I have dynamodb-janusgraph-storage-backend listed as a dependency in my pom.xml file so everything is compiling just fine.<br/><br/>I've found examples of how to use Gremlin with dynamodb/janusgraph but nothing about how to set things up purely in Java. An example would be greatly appreciated." ]]></description>
