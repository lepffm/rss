While playing around with `ActionView::Component` i noticed that it is not possible to render components in the controller. I saw, that you are monkey patching `ActionView::Base#render`. So i tried to override the `render` method in my `ApplicationController` in a similar way, but without success.<br/><br/>At the moment users are forced to write templates with a single line: `<%= render(PostShowComponent, post: @post)
 %>`. It would be great to have an API like this:<br/><br/>```ruby <br/>class PostsController < ApplicationController<br/>  def show <br/>    post = Post.find(params[:id])
<br/>    render(PostShowComponent, post: post)
<br/>  end<br/>end<br/>```<br/>I could provide a PR with a failing feature test, if that helps. <br/><br/>Thank you , ushi<br/><br/>P.S. Found a workaround. Maybe its a good starting point:<br/><br/>```ruby<br/>class ApplicationController<br/>  private<br/><br/>  def render_component(component, args, **options)
<br/>    options = options.reverse_merge(layout: true)
<br/>    render(html: view_context.render(component, args)
, options)
<br/>  end <br/>end<br/>```<br/><br/>" ]]></description></item><item>	<title>Any tips for rendering Components from collections?</title>	<link>https://github.com/github/actionview-component/issues/21</link>	<description><![CDATA[Before I start playing around with this, I wanted to ask if there is a preferred way, best practice, or even a helper to render components for collections  <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/layouts_and_rendering.html#rendering-collections">similar to the rails guide for partials</a> 

<br/><br/>I think this would be a common use case, and would be willing to submit a PR for a documentation example." ]]></description></item><item>	<title>Wanted: Experience Reports</title>	<link>https://github.com/github/actionview-component/issues/15</link>	<description><![CDATA[üëã thanks for checking out `actionview-component`!<br/><br/>In sharing this gem with the Rails community, we are looking to hear about your experiences with using `ActionView::Component` in your applications.<br/><br/>Please let us know what works well, what doesn't, and what you think is missing ‚ù§Ô∏è <br/><br/>If you'd rather provide feedback privately, feel free to contact me at joelhawksley@github.com." ]]></description></item><item>	<title>Implement Poisson distribution</title>	<link>https://github.com/awslabs/gluon-ts/issues/529</link>	<description><![CDATA[The Poisson distribution is currently missing." ]]></description></item><item>	<title>Missing distributions</title>	<link>https://github.com/awslabs/gluon-ts/issues/467</link>	<description><![CDATA[Some of the distributions which are currently missing are:<br/>- [x]  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_distribution">Gamma</a>
