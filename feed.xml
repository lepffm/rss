After updating to AMI v20191119 the allocatable memory went down from 16132820Ki to 13461148Ki. Also the allocatable CPU went down to 3920m which is less important. Wondering what's going on here.<br/>" ]]></description></item><item>	<title>Functions: Cannot specify 'Pinned' value</title>	<link>https://github.com/awslabs/aws-greengrass-group-setup/issues/9</link>	<description><![CDATA[As the API is currently exposed, lambda functions referenced with gg_group_setup are on-demand by default with no option to set them to pinned.  I need a way to specify that a lambda function is long-lived / pinned – see  <a href="http://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/services/greengrass.html?highlight=greengrass#Greengrass.Client.create_function_definition">create_function_definition</a> 

.<br/><br/>I've been able hack in support by overriding GroupCommands._create_function_definition in a subclass.<br/><br/>After subclassing, the relevant config  –<br/>`<br/>  \"lambda_functions\": {<br/>    \"function_name\": {<br/>      \"arn\": \"function_arn\",<br/>      \"arn_qualifier\": \"dev\"<br/>    }<br/>`<br/>– is updated to look like this –<br/>`<br/>  \"lambda_functions\": {<br/>    \"function_name\": {<br/>      \"arn\": \"function_arn\",<br/>      \"arn_qualifier\": \"dev\",<br/>      \"pinned\": false<br/>    }<br/>`<br/><br/>Are there plans to expose this functionality?  I can package these changes up into a PR if that's helpful." ]]></description></item></channel></rss>
