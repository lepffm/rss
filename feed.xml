While playing around with `ActionView::Component` i noticed that it is not possible to render components in the controller. I saw, that you are monkey patching `ActionView::Base#render`. So i tried to override the `render` method in my `ApplicationController` in a similar way, but without success.<br/><br/>At the moment users are forced to write templates with a single line: `<%= render(PostShowComponent, post: @post)
 %>`. It would be great to have an API like this:<br/><br/>```ruby <br/>class PostsController < ApplicationController<br/>  def show <br/>    post = Post.find(params[:id])
<br/>    render(PostShowComponent, post: post)
<br/>  end<br/>end<br/>```<br/>I could provide a PR with a failing feature test, if that helps. <br/><br/>Thank you , ushi<br/><br/>P.S. Found a workaround. Maybe its a good starting point:<br/><br/>```ruby<br/>class ApplicationController<br/>  private<br/><br/>  def render_component(component, args, **options)
<br/>    options = options.reverse_merge(layout: true)
<br/>    render(html: view_context.render(component, args)
, options)
<br/>  end <br/>end<br/>```<br/><br/>" ]]></description></item><item>	<title>Any tips for rendering Components from collections?</title>	<link>https://github.com/github/actionview-component/issues/21</link>	<description><![CDATA[Before I start playing around with this, I wanted to ask if there is a preferred way, best practice, or even a helper to render components for collections  <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/layouts_and_rendering.html#rendering-collections">similar to the rails guide for partials</a> 

<br/><br/>I think this would be a common use case, and would be willing to submit a PR for a documentation example." ]]></description></item><item>	<title>Wanted: Experience Reports</title>	<link>https://github.com/github/actionview-component/issues/15</link>	<description><![CDATA[👋 thanks for checking out `actionview-component`!<br/><br/>In sharing this gem with the Rails community, we are looking to hear about your experiences with using `ActionView::Component` in your applications.<br/><br/>Please let us know what works well, what doesn't, and what you think is missing ❤️ <br/><br/>If you'd rather provide feedback privately, feel free to contact me at joelhawksley@github.com." ]]></description></item><item>	<title>Unable to use elasticsearch fields starting with underscore in Grafana</title>	<link>https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/20692</link>	<description><![CDATA[<!--<br/>Please use this template while reporting a bug and provide as much info as possible.<br/>Questions should be posted to https://community.grafana.com<br/>Use query inspector to troubleshoot issues: https://community.grafana.com/t/using-grafanas-query-inspector-to-troubleshoot-issues/2630<br/>--><br/><br/>**What happened**: I tried to use the elasticsearch datasource in Grafana and it cannot detect my timestamp field as it starts with (two)
 underscores. <br/><br/>**What you expected to happen**: Grafana should allow fields starting with one or more underscores<br/><br/>**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)
**: Use `__timestamp` instead of `@timestamp` as the name of the date field in your mapping <br/><br/>**Anything else we need to know?**: A large number of my fields start with an underscore. The system is large and old with multiple writers and consumers, which makes it very difficult to change all these fields to not start with an underscore.<br/><br/>**Environment**:<br/>- Grafana version: v6.3.5 (67bad72)
<br/>- Data source type &amp; version: elasticsearch 6.4<br/>- OS Grafana is installed on: Linux<br/>- User OS &amp; Browser: macOS Mojave, Chrome<br/>- Grafana plugins: elasticsearch<br/>- Others:<br/>" ]]></description></item></channel></rss>
