While playing around with `ActionView::Component` i noticed that it is not possible to render components in the controller. I saw, that you are monkey patching `ActionView::Base#render`. So i tried to override the `render` method in my `ApplicationController` in a similar way, but without success.<br/><br/>At the moment users are forced to write templates with a single line: `<%= render(PostShowComponent, post: @post)
 %>`. It would be great to have an API like this:<br/><br/>```ruby <br/>class PostsController < ApplicationController<br/>  def show <br/>    post = Post.find(params[:id])
<br/>    render(PostShowComponent, post: post)
<br/>  end<br/>end<br/>```<br/>I could provide a PR with a failing feature test, if that helps. <br/><br/>Thank you , ushi<br/><br/>P.S. Found a workaround. Maybe its a good starting point:<br/><br/>```ruby<br/>class ApplicationController<br/>  private<br/><br/>  def render_component(component, args, **options)
<br/>    options = options.reverse_merge(layout: true)
<br/>    render(html: view_context.render(component, args)
, options)
<br/>  end <br/>end<br/>```<br/><br/>" ]]></description></item><item>	<title>Any tips for rendering Components from collections?</title>	<link>https://github.com/github/actionview-component/issues/21</link>	<description><![CDATA[Before I start playing around with this, I wanted to ask if there is a preferred way, best practice, or even a helper to render components for collections  <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/layouts_and_rendering.html#rendering-collections">similar to the rails guide for partials</a> 

<br/><br/>I think this would be a common use case, and would be willing to submit a PR for a documentation example." ]]></description></item><item>	<title>Clojure(Script)

.<br/><br/>**Why is this needed**: If someone does not pay much attention to the documentation and does not see that the provisioning provider names must be unique, a weird problem can appear: some dashboards are randomly not found. They might not appear in the interface, or it might show a \"dashboard not found\" error.<br/><br/>I believe what's happening is that Grafana must be overwriting the provider settings, the paths for provisioning are overwritten too and it makes Grafana delete dashboards when it does not find them in one of the paths, and then add them again when it finds them in the other one.<br/><br/>I think this is very low priority as the unique provider name is documented, but it would be nice to have something in the logs that tells us we made a mistake. I'm also posting this issue in case someone has the same problem as me (for example, I stumbled upon #14929 and #16016 which can be related)
