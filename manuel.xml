        <title>Makefile doesn't yet include 1.14</title>

        <title>Add support for multiple deployoment OU in nested structure</title>
        <link>https://github.com/awslabs/aws-deployment-framework/issues/130</link>
        <description><![CDATA[We're looking to implement ADF for our organisation, and at the moment it works pretty well for just our team. In future, if all goes smoothly with our spike, we'll likely be looking to roll this out to multiple teams in the larger group, we wouldn't want to share a deployment account since we need that separation (and there would be a lot of pipelines in there getting cluttered). However we do still share an Organization (billing reasons, Security, etc), and we think it would be great if ADF could support multiple deployment accounts in a similar structure as listed below:\r<br/>\r<br/>```\r<br/>+ root org\r<br/>     + team1\r<br/>          + deployment\r<br/>               - tooling-account (isolated to only allow deployment to units within team1)\r<br/>          + production\r<br/>               - team1-prod\r<br/>          + staging\r<br/>               - team1-staging\r<br/>     + team2\r<br/>          + deployment\r<br/>               - tooling-account (isolated to only allow deployment to units within team2)\r<br/>          + production\r<br/>               - team2-prod\r<br/>          + staging\r<br/>               - team2-staging\r<br/>     + team3\r<br/>          + deployment\r<br/>               - tooling-account (isolated to only allow deployment to units within team3)\r<br/>          + production\r<br/>               - team3-prod\r<br/>          + staging\r<br/>               - team3-staging\r<br/>```\r<br/>\r<br/>Is this the sort of feature that could be implemented at some point? Its my understanding that currently the tool only supports one deployment account due to the system-parameters upon initialisation.\r<br/>\r<br/>Another structure that could work, but we aren't sure if its possible/how to implement:\r<br/>\r<br/>```\r<br/>+ root org\r<br/>    + deployment\r<br/>         - team1-tooling\r<br/>         - team2-tooling\r<br/>         - team3-tooling\r<br/>     + team1\r<br/>          + production\r<br/>               - team1-prod\r<br/>          + staging\r<br/>               - team1-staging\r<br/>     + team2\r<br/>          + production\r<br/>               - team2-prod\r<br/>          + staging\r<br/>               - team2-staging\r<br/>     + team3\r<br/>          + production\r<br/>               - team3-prod\r<br/>          + staging\r<br/>               - team3-staging\r<br/>```" ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[As a user, I should be able to write my IAM policy statements in either JSON or YAML and the tool should automatically handle either format.\r<br/>\r<br/>Ideally this would be a distinct feature from the `--format` flag introduced in https://github.com/awslabs/aws-iam-generator/pull/13 which IMO should be refactored to influence the CloudFormation output format only.\r<br/>" ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[This operator will be very useful to help determine different scenes in video.  Applications include searching for ads, credits, slates, scenes.  Another application is that applying ML to unique scenes would save processing time by running ML on still frames, rather than on video." ]]></description>

        <title>trouble with connecting to dynamodb through Java</title>
        <link>https://github.com/awslabs/dynamodb-janusgraph-storage-backend/issues/233</link>
        <description><![CDATA[Hi - I have the following Java code which I am trying to use to have Janusgraph connect to the cloud dynamodb (as opposed to the local test version).\r<br/>\r<br/>import org.apache.commons.configuration.BaseConfiguration;\r<br/>import com.amazon.janusgraph.diskstorage.dynamodb.DynamoDBStoreManager;\r<br/>import org.janusgraph.core.JanusGraphFactory;\r<br/>import org.janusgraph.core.JanusGraph;\r<br/>.....\r<br/>BaseConfiguration conf = new BaseConfiguration();\r<br/>conf.setProperty(\"storage.backend\",\"com.amazon.janusgraph.diskstorage.dynamodb.DynamoDBStoreManager\");\r<br/>....JanusGraph graph = JanusGraphFactory.open(conf);\r<br/>\r<br/>The error I'm getting when trying to run is:\r<br/>\"errorMessage\": \"Could not instantiate implementation: com.amazon.janusgraph.diskstorage.dynamodb.DynamoDBStoreManager\",\r<br/>....\r<br/>\"errorType\": \"java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError\",\r<br/>\r<br/>Is this a bug or am I missing something? Thought importing com.amazon.janusgraph.diskstorage.dynamodb.DynamoDBStoreManager would be enough - I have dynamodb-janusgraph-storage-backend listed as a dependency in my pom.xml file so everything is compiling just fine.\r<br/>\r<br/>I've found examples of how to use Gremlin with dynamodb/janusgraph but nothing about how to set things up purely in Java. An example would be greatly appreciated." ]]></description>
